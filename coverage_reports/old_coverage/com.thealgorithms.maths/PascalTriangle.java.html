    /**
     *In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients that arises
     * in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra. In much of the Western world, it is named after
     * the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although other mathematicians studied it centuries before
     * him in India, Persia, China, Germany, and Italy.
     *
     * The rows of Pascal's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row n=0 at the top (the 0th row).
     * The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with k=0 and are usually staggered relative
     * to the numbers in the adjacent rows. The triangle may be constructed in the following manner:
     * In row 0 (the topmost row), there is a unique nonzero entry 1. Each entry of each subsequent row is
     * constructed by adding the number above and to the left with the number above and to the right, treating
     * blank entries as 0. For example, the initial number in the first (or any other) row is 1 (the sum of 0 and 1),
     * whereas the numbers 1 and 3 in the third row are added to produce the number 4 in the fourth row. *
